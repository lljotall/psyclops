            This app was built on top of the sample that demonstrates the basic use of CameraX API.\n
            It generates sounds based on the color of the central pixel captured by the camera.\n
            Clicks with at a higher frequency mean brighter colors, while spaced clicks mean darker colors.
            High pitch means colors closer to blue, while low pitch clicks correspond to red-ish tones.\n
            Psyclops is still in its infancy and will be refined in later versions.\n\n
            The Training Mode allows you to validate your skills in aiming at an object and recall its color by the sound produced.
            The Wake Lock blocks the phone from Locking, so you can run the app for longer periods of time.
